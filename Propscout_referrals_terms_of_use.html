        <h2>PROPSCOUT LIMITED REFERRALS TERMS OF AGREEMENT</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>This agreement establishes a referral arrangement between Propscout Ltd. (“Propscout”) and 
        Real estate professionals, eg property managers and real estate agents and brokers (“Broker”), including any agents operating under the Broker. 
        </p> 
        <P>Propscout Limited has created a system to generate and deliver quality referrals to real estate professionals . A ‘referral’, on for sale properties, is defined as any client or co-client that is delivered to the brokerage partner and has 
            indicated the need and desire for a specific real estate transaction within the subsequent 24 months.</P>
            
        <p>During this 24 month period, a referral fee is owed to Propscout Limited 
            for all real estate transactions 
            facilitated for this client, regardless of whether the client was withdrawn from the agent or agency's 
            pipeline. The referral is property of Propscout Limited
            and we reserve the right to rescind the referral at any 
            time.</p>

        <p> For for-rent properties, Propscout Limited sends information on renters who have expressed interest on the rental property advertised, to property managers or landlords . When the prospective renter elects to stay in the rental property, Propscout Limited will be owed a commission from the resultant transaction by the landlord or property manager.</p>

        <h2> Amendment and Waiver</h2>
        <P>This Agreement may not be modified, amended, 
            supplemented, canceled or discharged, except by written instrument executed by all 
            Parties. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or 
            privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or 
            partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of 
            any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of any breach of any provision shall 
            be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any 
            other provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between 
            the Parties. No extension of time for performance of any obligations or other acts 
            hereunder or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of the 
            time for performance of any other obligations or any other acts. The rights and 
            remedies of the Parties under this Agreement are in addition to all other rights and 
            remedies, at law or equity, that they may have against each other.</P>

        <h2>Assignment. Third Party Beneficiary.</h2>
        <p>This Agreement, and the Referring Broker’s 
            rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned or subcontracted by the 
            Receiving Broker, unless he has first obtained the written consent of 
            Propscout Limited. Propscout Limited only allows up to a maximum of 2 agents on any real estate marketing pipeline and therefore any transaction .</p>
          
         <p>Mediation and Arbitration: If any dispute or claim in law or equity arises out of this Agreement, and the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the 
            parties agree to attempt in good faith to settle such dispute or claim by non-binding mediation through one of the local Kenya Boards of 
            REALTORS®, or through a mutually agreed upon dispute resolution company located nearby. If the mediation is not successful, the parties agree 
            to binding arbitration before one of the local Boards of REALTORS®, or before a mutually agreed upon arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
            
        <h2>Governing Law:</h2> 
        <p> This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of Kenya. The Kenyan courts as applicable, shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over 
            any action, claim, demand, proceeding or lawsuit whatsoever arising under or in relation to this Agreement or its subject matter. The parties 
            irrevocably agree, consent and submit themselves to the subject matter and personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purposes. The arbitration 
            of any dispute under this Agreement shall be held in Kenya.</p>   

        <h2>Complete Agreement</h2>
        <p>This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior 
            agreements, oral or written, and all other communications, promises or discussions between the parties relating to the subject matter of the 
            Agreement. This Agreement may only be amended by a written instrument executed by both parties hereto. 
            </p>

        <h2>PROPSCOUT LIMITED Referral Policies </h2>
        <h4>Competing Referral Programs</h4>
        <p>If a brokerage receives the same client from multiple referral sources, PROPSCOUT LTD 
            practices a "first
            in" policy. If the brokerage has received a referral for the same client from another lead source, then 
            Propscout Limited
            
            will request verification that the referral was received first from another source. 
            Otherwise, Propscout Limited
            reserves the right to request payment of the referral fee upon a successful 
            closing with the client.</p>

        <h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>
        <p>Broker’s participation in Propscout service is voluntary and can be terminated by either party at any time with 
            written notice. However, any Referrals made prior to such termination are still bound by this agreement, and 
            referral fees (calculated per the above) will be due upon close of any transactions resulting from such Referrals.
